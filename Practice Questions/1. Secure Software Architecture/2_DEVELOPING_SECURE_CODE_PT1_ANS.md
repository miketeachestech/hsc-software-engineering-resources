## **Short Answer Questions**

**4.** *(3 marks)* Explain the differences between confidentiality, integrity, and availability in software security.
- **1 mark** for defining **confidentiality** as protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.
- **1 mark** for defining **integrity** as ensuring data remains unaltered unless modified by authorized users.
- **1 mark** for defining **availability** as ensuring system reliability and protection against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

**5.** *(3 marks)* Describe how encryption and hashing differ in securing data.
- **1 mark** for explaining that **encryption** converts data into a secret format that can be decrypted with a key.
- **1 mark** for explaining that **hashing** transforms data into a fixed-length string that is irreversible.
- **1 mark** for providing an example: passwords are stored using hashing, while encryption is used for securing messages.

**6.** *(2 marks)* Give two examples of how role-based access control (RBAC) is used in secure systems.
- **1 mark** for an example of RBAC in a school web portal where students can view assignments but only teachers can grade them.
- **1 mark** for an example of RBAC in a hospital database where doctors can update patient records, but administrative staff can only view them.
