## **Short Answer Questions**

**4.** *(3 marks)* Explain how **polynomial regression** differs from **linear regression**, and provide an example of when polynomial regression is more suitable.  
- **1 mark** for stating that polynomial regression captures curved relationships, while linear regression fits a straight line.  
- **1 mark** for explaining that polynomial regression adds higher-degree terms (e.g., x², x³) to the model.  
- **1 mark** for providing an example (e.g., predicting the trajectory of a rocket, where a straight-line model is insufficient).  

**5.** *(3 marks)* Describe the three key components of a **neural network** (input layer, hidden layers, output layer) and their functions.  
- **1 mark** for defining the **input layer** as the layer that receives raw data.  
- **1 mark** for defining the **hidden layers** as layers that process and transform input data using weights and activation functions.  
- **1 mark** for defining the **output layer** as the layer that produces the final prediction or classification.  

**6.** *(3 marks)* How do **activation functions and optimizers** contribute to improving a neural network’s performance? Provide examples.  
- **1 mark** for explaining that activation functions decide which neurons contribute to the model’s output (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid).  
- **1 mark** for stating that optimizers adjust model weights to minimize error (e.g., Adam, Gradient Descent).  
- **1 mark** for providing an example of how these improve training (e.g., using ReLU for deep networks to reduce vanishing gradient issues).

- **1 mark** for explaining how OOP allows modular code reuse (e.g., creating reusable ML model classes).  
- **1 mark** for discussing encapsulation and abstraction in OOP-based ML.  
- **1 mark** for providing an example (e.g., a Python class for a Linear Regression model).  

**8.** *(4 marks)* Explain how **reinforcement learning** and **neural networks** work together to improve AI-driven automation. Provide a real-world example.  
- **1 mark** for defining reinforcement learning as a model that learns through rewards and penalties.  
- **1 mark** for explaining that neural networks process complex patterns and improve decision-making.  
- **1 mark** for discussing their combination in AI automation (e.g., training self-driving cars).  
- **1 mark** for providing an example (e.g., AlphaGo using reinforcement learning to improve strategy in board games).  

**9.** *(4 marks)* How does **ChatGPT utilize neural networks** to generate human-like responses? Discuss key ML techniques involved.  
- **1 mark** for explaining that ChatGPT is based on a **Transformer model** using deep learning.  
- **1 mark** for discussing the use of **self-attention mechanisms** to understand context.  
- **1 mark** for mentioning **reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)** to improve responses.  
- **1 mark** for providing an example (e.g., predicting the next most likely word in a conversation).
