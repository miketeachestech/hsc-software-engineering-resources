## **Short Answer Questions**

**4.** *(3 marks)* Explain the importance of **internationalisation** in web development, and how developers can implement it in their applications.  
- **1 mark** for defining **internationalisation** as ensuring web applications function across different languages and cultural contexts.  
- **1 mark** for mentioning implementation techniques such as **right-to-left (RTL) support, date/time localization, and language attributes**.  
- **1 mark** for providing an example, such as **setting the `lang` attribute in HTML**.  

**5.** *(3 marks)* Describe the key differences between **client-side programming and server-side programming** in web development.  
- **1 mark** for defining **client-side programming** (executes in the browser, uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript).  
- **1 mark** for defining **server-side programming** (executes on a web server, uses languages like Python, PHP, Node.js).  
- **1 mark** for explaining how the two interact (e.g., a web form uses JavaScript for validation before sending data to a server for processing).  

**6.** *(3 marks)* How do **developer tools in web browsers** help developers debug and optimize web applications? Provide examples.  
- **1 mark** for mentioning that dev tools allow **inspecting and modifying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in real-time**.  
- **1 mark** for explaining the **network tab**, which helps developers monitor API requests and response times.  
- **1 mark** for providing an example (e.g., using Chrome DevTools to debug a JavaScript error in the console).

## **Extended Response Questions**

**7.** *(4 marks)* Discuss the role of **databases in web applications**, comparing SQL and NoSQL databases and their advantages in different scenarios.  
- **1 mark** for defining **SQL databases** (structured, relational, uses tables).  
- **1 mark** for defining **NoSQL databases** (non-relational, flexible schema, uses document-based storage).  
- **1 mark** for discussing advantages (e.g., SQL for complex queries, NoSQL for scalability and big data).  
- **1 mark** for providing an example (e.g., MySQL for an e-commerce site, MongoDB for a real-time chat app).  

**8.** *(4 marks)* Explain how **CSS frameworks and preprocessors** impact the development and maintenance of modern web applications. Provide examples.  
- **1 mark** for defining **CSS frameworks** (pre-designed stylesheets for faster development, e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind).  
- **1 mark** for defining **CSS preprocessors** (extend CSS functionality with variables, mixins, e.g., SASS, LESS).  
- **1 mark** for explaining how they improve maintainability and efficiency.  
- **1 mark** for providing an example (e.g., Bootstrap grid system for responsive design, SASS variables for color themes).  

**9.** *(4 marks)* How do **security standards set by W3C** help protect user data and enhance trust in web applications? Provide real-world examples.  
- **1 mark** for mentioning **Content Security Policy (CSP)** to prevent XSS attacks.  
- **1 mark** for explaining **secure authentication practices** supported by W3C.  
- **1 mark** for discussing **privacy and data protection standards** (e.g., cookie consent policies).  
- **1 mark** for providing a real-world example (e.g., W3C standards for HTTPS and secure form handling).
