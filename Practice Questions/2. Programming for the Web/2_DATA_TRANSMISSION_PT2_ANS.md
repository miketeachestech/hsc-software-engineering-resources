## **Short Answer Questions**

**4.** *(3 marks)* Explain the difference between **plain text and cipher text**, and why encryption is necessary for secure communication.  
- **1 mark** for defining **plain text** as readable, unencrypted data.  
- **1 mark** for defining **cipher text** as encrypted data that appears scrambled.  
- **1 mark** for explaining how encryption prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information.  

**5.** *(3 marks)* Describe the steps involved in an **encryption handshake** when establishing a secure HTTPS connection.  
- **1 mark** for explaining the **Client Hello** (client sends encryption method preferences to the server).  
- **1 mark** for explaining the **Server Hello** (server selects an encryption method and sends an SSL/TLS certificate).  
- **1 mark** for describing the **key exchange**, where a shared session key is generated and secure communication begins.  

**6.** *(3 marks)* What is the role of **digital signatures** in verifying the authenticity of transmitted data?  
- **1 mark** for explaining that digital signatures ensure data **has not been tampered with**.  
- **1 mark** for mentioning that they use **asymmetric encryption** to verify authenticity.  
- **1 mark** for providing an example, such as verifying the authenticity of **downloaded software or emails**.

## **Extended Response Questions**

**7.** *(4 marks)* Discuss the impact of **big data on web architecture**, including the role of **data mining, metadata, and streaming service management**.  
- **1 mark** for defining **big data** and its role in modern web architecture.  
- **1 mark** for explaining **data mining** and how it analyzes large datasets for patterns.  
- **1 mark** for describing **metadata** and its use in tracking and organizing data.  
- **1 mark** for explaining **streaming service management** and how it optimizes content delivery (e.g., Netflix’s adaptive streaming).  

**8.** *(4 marks)* Explain how **encryption algorithms** such as AES, RSA, and ECC enhance data security, and provide examples of their real-world applications.  
- **1 mark** for defining **AES** (used for securing sensitive data, e.g., encrypted hard drives).  
- **1 mark** for defining **RSA** (commonly used for securing web traffic and digital certificates).  
- **1 mark** for defining **ECC** (provides strong encryption with smaller key sizes, often used in mobile security).  
- **1 mark** for providing a real-world example (e.g., AES for encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp, RSA for SSL/TLS encryption, ECC for blockchain security).  

**9.** *(4 marks)* How does the **TLS encryption handshake process** work, and why is it crucial for securing online transactions?  
- **1 mark** for explaining the **Client Hello** and the client listing supported encryption methods.  
- **1 mark** for explaining the **Server Hello** and the server sending an SSL/TLS certificate.  
- **1 mark** for describing how a **shared secret key** is generated using asymmetric encryption.  
- **1 mark** for discussing why TLS is crucial for securing online transactions (e.g., protecting credit card details on e-commerce sites).
