## **Short Answer Questions**

**4.** *(3 marks)* Explain the **advantages and disadvantages** of using the **Waterfall Model** in software development.  
- **1 mark** for stating that the Waterfall Model is structured and easy to manage.  
- **1 mark** for explaining that it works best for well-defined projects with fixed requirements.  
- **1 mark** for describing its main disadvantage: difficulty adapting to changes late in development.  

**5.** *(3 marks)* Describe the **iteration workflow** in the Agile development model and its benefits.  
- **1 mark** for describing that Agile development follows repeated cycles (iterations) consisting of planning, development, testing, and review.  
- **1 mark** for stating that Agile allows flexibility and quick adaptation to user feedback.  
- **1 mark** for providing an example (e.g., developing a mobile app where new features are released in small updates).  

**6.** *(3 marks)* What are the **key differences between Waterfall, Agile, and WAgile** development approaches? Provide an example of when each might be used.  
- **1 mark** for stating that Waterfall follows a sequential approach, while Agile is iterative.  
- **1 mark** for explaining that WAgile combines Waterfall’s structured planning with Agile’s flexibility.  
- **1 mark** for providing examples (e.g., Waterfall for government projects, Agile for mobile app startups, WAgile for enterprise software development).

## **Extended Response Questions**

**7.** *(4 marks)* Discuss the role of **method tailoring** in Agile software development. Provide an example of how a company might modify Agile to fit its project needs.  
- **1 mark** for defining method tailoring as adjusting Agile frameworks to suit project-specific needs.  
- **1 mark** for explaining why method tailoring is important for flexibility and efficiency.  
- **1 mark** for describing how a company might combine Scrum and Kanban for better workflow.  
- **1 mark** for providing an example (e.g., a startup using Agile but adding structured documentation for regulatory compliance).  

**8.** *(4 marks)* How does the **scale of a project** influence the choice of development model? Provide examples of projects best suited for Waterfall, Agile, and WAgile.  
- **1 mark** for explaining that small projects benefit from Agile due to rapid iteration.  
- **1 mark** for stating that large projects with strict requirements are better suited for Waterfall.  
- **1 mark** for describing WAgile as a solution for complex projects needing both structure and adaptability.  
- **1 mark** for providing examples (e.g., Waterfall for large healthcare systems, Agile for a mobile app, WAgile for enterprise business software).  

**9.** *(4 marks)* Compare and contrast **the risks and benefits** of using WAgile versus Agile in a large-scale project.  
- **1 mark** for explaining that WAgile provides structured planning while allowing Agile flexibility.  
- **1 mark** for discussing the risk of WAgile being slower due to early Waterfall phases.  
- **1 mark** for stating that Agile may struggle with large-scale regulatory projects.  
- **1 mark** for providing an example (e.g., a large banking system might use WAgile to balance compliance and development speed).
