# Collection of resources for HSC Software Engineering

This repository contains revision notes and practice questions that I've made in-line with the content dot points found in the NESA curriculum document. I've also uploaded the NESA files related to this subject here for your convenience, but keep in mind that they might be out-of-date if you're looking at these years later (so it's better for you to go get them directly from the NESA website).
