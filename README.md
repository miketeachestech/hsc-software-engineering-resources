# Collection of resources for HSC Software Engineering

This repository includes revision notes and practice questions that I’ve created, aligned with the content points outlined in the NESA HSC Software Engineering curriculum. When I compiled these materials, there were limited resources available (e.g., no dedicated textbook for the subject), so please be aware that some content may have changed or evolved over time if you’re reviewing this in the future.

For your convenience, I’ve also uploaded the relevant NESA documents related to this subject. However, keep in mind that they could be outdated. To ensure you're working with the most current information, I recommend downloading the latest versions directly from the NESA website.

I also strongly suggest using the "HSC Software Engineering Familiarisation Questions" at https://fam.hsconline.nesa.nsw.edu.au/ to practice making diagrams with the NESA draw tool. Try making a class diagram, structure chart, decision tree, and data flow diagram. You will need to be quite confident and fast with this tool in your exam.

Please note that I don’t recommend relying on older Software Design & Development resources to study for this subject, as the content in Software Engineering is quite different.

### Disclaimer: 

I am not affiliated with NESA, nor am I a secondary teacher. The materials provided here are based on publicly available information regarding the HSC Software Engineering curriculum, and are shared as a best-effort resource. Use them at your own discretion. Additionally, the language I use in practice questions (e.g., “describe,” “evaluate,” “define”) may not always align with the specific terminology used by NESA.

Good luck with your studies! :)
